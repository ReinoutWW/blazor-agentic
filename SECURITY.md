## Security Best Practices

### 🔐 For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web application security
4. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server

7. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly

### 🏗️ For Infrastructure

1. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
2. **Implement proper firewall rules**
3. **Regular security updates** for base images
4. **Network segmentation** between services
5. **Backup encryption** and secure storage
6. **Access logging** and monitoring
7. **Principle of least privilege** for service accounts

### 🚀 For Deployment

1. **Secure CI/CD pipelines** with proper access controls
2. **Environment separation** (dev/staging/prod)
3. **Secrets management** via secure secret stores
4. **Container scanning** before deployment
5. **Infrastructure as Code** for consistency
6. **Monitoring and alerting** for security events
